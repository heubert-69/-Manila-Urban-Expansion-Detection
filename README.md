🔧 Customization
Modifying Expected Features:
Edit the expected_features list in app.py:

```python
expected_features = [
    'B1_coastal', 'B2_blue', 'B3_green', 'B4_red', 
    'B5_nir', 'B6_swir1', 'B7_swir2',
    'NDVI', 'NDBI', 'NDWI', 'brightness', 
    'ratio_swir_nir', 'ratio_nir_red'
]
```
Adding New Visualizations:
Extend the plotting section in predict_urbanization_csv() function:

```python
# Add new subplot
ax5 = plt.subplot(2, 3, 5)  # Adjust grid as needed
ax5.plot(new_data)
ax5.set_title('New Visualization')
```
Model Replacement:
Replace model.pkl with your new model file. Ensure it has:

.model attribute: Trained classifier

.scaler attribute: Fitted StandardScaler

.feature_names attribute: List of expected features

🐛 Troubleshooting
Common Issues:
Missing Model File:

```text
❌ Pickle file urban_model.pkl not found
Solution: Ensure urban_model.pkl is in the root directory
```

CSV Format Error:

```text
❌ Missing features in CSV: B5_nir, NDVI, ...
Solution: Check column names match expected features
```
```text
Memory Issues:
Solution: Reduce sample size or upgrade Hugging Face Space hardware
```
```text
Visualization Errors:
Solution: Check for NaN values in input data
```
```text
Performance Tips:
Use smaller CSV files for testing (<10,000 rows)
```

Pre-calculate spectral indices before upload

Ensure numeric columns don't contain text values

Handle missing values before upload
